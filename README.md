# RayTracer
A (basic and primitive) ray tracer written in Python using NumPy to do a lot of the vector mathematics and Pillow to create the output image.

Currently, we can add 'spheres' to the scene and the ray tracer can compute the intersections and shade pixels as a result. I hope to add to this little by little by adding support for shadows, reflections, materials and so on.

## Running Instructions
Clone the repo and install `Pillow` and `Numpy` using `pip3`. Then run `python3 raytracer.py` and view `output.png` in the same location. A `requirements.txt` will be made one day.
